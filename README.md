## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms in Java repository! This project is dedicated to documenting my daily learning journey as I explore various data structures and algorithms using the Java programming language. The goal is to deepen my understanding of these fundamental concepts and improve my problem-solving skills.

Each day, I will learn about a new data structure or algorithm, implement it in Java, and document my understanding and progress in this repository. I hope this project can serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about data structures and algorithms in Java.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

- `src/`: Contains all Java source code files.
  - `data_structures/`: Java implementations of various data structures.
  - `algorithms/`: Java implementations of various algorithms.
  - `utils/`: Utility classes and functions used across the project.
- `test/`: Contains test cases for data structures and algorithms.
- `docs/`: Contains detailed documentation for each data structure and algorithm.
- `log/`: Daily learning logs documenting my progress and insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode) or a text editor
- Maven or Gradle for project management (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-algorithms-java.git
   cd data-structures-algorithms-java
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or text editor.

### Running the Code

To run any of the implemented data structures or algorithms:

1. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
2. Locate the Java file you want to run.
3. Execute the file using your IDE's run configuration or from the command line:

   ```bash
   javac src/data_structures/ArrayExample.java
   java src/data_structures/ArrayExample
   ```

## Daily Learning Log

Each day, I document my learning journey in the `log/` directory. The logs include:

- The topic of the day (e.g., a specific data structure or algorithm)
- Key concepts and insights
- Challenges faced and how I overcame them
- Code snippets and explanations

## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that store elements in a fixed-size sequential collection. They allow for efficient access by index but have limitations in terms of dynamic resizing.

### Linked Lists

Linked Lists consist of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence. They are useful for efficient insertions and deletions but have slower access times compared to arrays.

### Stacks

Stacks are a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. They support operations such as push (add an element), pop (remove the top element), and peek (view the top element).

### Queues

Queues are a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. Common operations include enqueue (add an element) and dequeue (remove an element).

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes, where each node has zero or more children. Common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.

### Graphs

Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They can be used to represent networks and relationships. Graph traversal algorithms include Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### Hash Tables

Hash Tables store key-value pairs and provide efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. They use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending). Common sorting algorithms include:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

### Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are used to find specific elements within a data structure. Common searching algorithms include:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is used in problems like the Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, and longest common subsequence.

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. Examples include the coin change problem and Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is a technique for solving problems incrementally, by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them if they do not lead to a valid solution. It is used in problems like solving mazes, puzzles, and the N-Queens problem.
