Java Data Structures and Algorithms Daily Learning

Welcome to my repository of daily learning and practice for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. This repository is designed to help anyone learn, practice, and master essential data structures and algorithms, with Java as the primary programming language.

üìÇ Folder Structure

This repository is divided into multiple directories, each focusing on a specific topic. The structure is designed for easier navigation and progressive learning. Below is an explanation of each directory.

Directory List

1. 00-Basic Math Program
Basic programs to understand fundamental math concepts like prime numbers, greatest common divisor (GCD), factorial, etc., helping you strengthen your problem-solving skills with mathematical operations.


2. 01-Pattern Programs
Programs for printing various patterns, using loops and conditionals. These are great for understanding control structures in Java and improving your logical thinking.


3. 02-Arrays Programs
This folder covers essential array-related problems, such as searching, sorting, merging, and rotating arrays. It is key to understanding one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science.


4. 03-Strings Programs
Solutions to common string manipulation problems, including reversing strings, checking for palindromes, and string searching algorithms like KMP and Rabin-Karp.


5. 04-OOP's Program
Programs illustrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, demonstrating how these principles are used to write maintainable and modular code.


6. 05-Recursion
Recursive problem-solving programs like factorial, Fibonacci sequence, and more. This section is critical for understanding how recursion works and when to use it.


7. 06-Basic Sorting Algorithms
This folder contains implementations of basic sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. Sorting is foundational for many algorithmic challenges.


8. 07-Divide and Conquer
Algorithms that break problems into smaller subproblems and combine the solutions. Examples include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search.


9. 08-Time and Space Complexity
Programs that emphasize the importance of analyzing the time and space efficiency of algorithms, a critical part of optimizing solutions.


10. 09-Backtracking
Solutions to complex problems like the N-Queens problem and Sudoku solver. Backtracking is useful for solving combinatorial problems efficiently.


11. 10-Bit Manipulation
Programs utilizing bitwise operators to solve problems efficiently, such as finding subsets, counting set bits, and swapping numbers without temporary variables.


12. 11-ArrayList
Understanding the ArrayList class and its common operations like adding, removing, and updating elements. ArrayLists provide a dynamic array solution in Java.


13. 12-Linked List
Programs implementing singly and doubly linked lists, covering basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, along with problems related to linked lists.


14. 13-Stack
Implementation and usage of the stack data structure for problems such as balancing parentheses, evaluating expressions, and backtracking algorithms.


15. 14-Queue
Programs focusing on the queue data structure, including circular queues, dequeues, and priority queues, used for problems involving breadth-first search (BFS) and scheduling algorithms.


16. 15-Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithmic solutions to problems like activity selection, Huffman coding, and coin change. These algorithms make locally optimal choices to arrive at a global solution.


17. 16-Binary Tree
Programs related to binary trees, covering traversal methods (preorder, inorder, postorder), insertion, deletion, and height/balance checking.


18. 17-Binary Search Tree
Solutions focusing on binary search trees, a special type of binary tree. Operations include searching, insertion, deletion, and finding minimum/maximum elements.


19. 18-Heaps
Understanding the heap data structure (both min-heap and max-heap) and its use in algorithms like heap sort, as well as implementing priority queues.


20. 19-Hashing
Programs implementing hash maps and hash sets to solve problems involving efficient searching, indexing, and duplicate removal.


21. 20-Tries
Trie data structure implementations, used mainly for efficient searching of strings and prefix-based algorithms.


22. 21-Graphs
Solutions to graph-related problems using Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm, and other graph algorithms for finding shortest paths, connected components, and cycles.


23. 22-Dynamic Programming
Solving complex problems using dynamic programming techniques. Problems include the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence (LCS), and matrix chain multiplication.


24. 23-Segment Tree
Implementation of segment trees for solving range query problems like sum queries, minimum/maximum queries, and range updates.
