# Java Data Structures and Algorithms Daily Learning

Welcome to my repository of daily learning and practice for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. This repository contains a variety of programs, exercises, and problem-solving implementations, which are neatly categorized by topics to help with systematic learning and revision.

## Folder Structure

The repository is divided into various folders, each focusing on a specific data structure or algorithm topic. This modular organization makes it easy to navigate and focus on learning or practicing a particular concept. Each directory includes Java programs and explanations of how each algorithm or data structure works.

2. **01-Pattern Programs**  
   This section consists of programs that print different patterns using loops (e.g., triangles, pyramids, and diamond shapes). These help in mastering control flow (loops and conditionals) and improve problem-solving skills by understanding how to structure the logic.

3. **02-Arrays Programs**  
   The array is a fundamental data structure, and this directory contains programs that perform various operations such as sorting, searching, reversing, and manipulating arrays. You'll also find common algorithms like finding duplicates, rotation, and merging arrays.

4. **03-Strings Programs**  
   String manipulation is essential in programming. This folder includes solutions for problems related to palindrome checking, string reversal, substring search, string sorting, and other common algorithms like anagram checking.

5. **04-OOP's Program**  
   This folder focuses on Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. You'll find examples that demonstrate how to apply these principles through practical programs, such as building classes for real-world objects.

6. **05-Recursion**  
   Recursive algorithms often lead to elegant and simple solutions. In this directory, you'll find recursive implementations of problems like factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence, Tower of Hanoi, and solving mazes.

7. **06-Basic Sorting Algorithms**  
   This folder covers the implementation of basic sorting techniques such as bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort. Sorting is crucial for many applications, and these programs will help you understand how different algorithms approach sorting.

8. **07-Divide and Conquer**  
   Programs in this directory demonstrate the divide-and-conquer approach, which is used in algorithms like merge sort and quick sort. These algorithms break the problem into smaller sub-problems, solve them, and then combine the results for the final solution.

9. **08-Time and Space**  
   This section is dedicated to analyzing time and space complexity. You'll find programs that compare the efficiency of different algorithms, helping you understand Big-O notation and why it matters for performance.

10. **09-Backtracking**  
   Backtracking is a method for solving constraint satisfaction problems. In this folder, you'll find solutions to problems like the N-Queens puzzle, Sudoku, and other problems that involve making a sequence of decisions, testing them, and undoing decisions that lead to failure.

11. **10-Bit Manipulation**  
   Bitwise operations are powerful for solving certain types of problems. Here, you'll find programs that utilize bitwise operators for tasks like checking if a number is a power of two, counting the number of 1s in a binary representation, and swapping numbers without a temporary variable.

12. **11-ArrayList**  
   This folder introduces the ArrayList class in Java, covering its methods like adding, removing, and accessing elements. You'll also find programs that demonstrate the differences between arrays and ArrayLists.

13. **12-Linked List**  
   Programs in this directory cover the implementation of singly and doubly linked lists, including operations like insertion, deletion, reversal, and detecting loops in linked lists.

14. **13-Stack**  
   Stacks are used in many algorithms, especially for problems involving recursion and backtracking. This section covers stack operations (push, pop, peek) and their applications, like expression evaluation and balancing parentheses.

15. **14-Queue**  
   Queues are useful for tasks that require order preservation, like BFS (breadth-first search) in graphs. This folder covers various queue implementations, including standard queues, deques, and priority queues.

16. **15-Greedy Algorithms**  
   Greedy algorithms are used when making a sequence of decisions to optimize a solution. In this folder, you'll find solutions to problems like the coin change problem, activity selection, and job scheduling.

17. **16-Binary Tree**  
   The binary tree is a fundamental data structure, and this directory contains implementations of binary trees, covering traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder), insertion, deletion, and height calculation.

18. **17-Binary Search Tree**  
   Binary Search Trees (BST) are a special kind of binary tree, and this section includes programs that implement common operations on BSTs like insertion, deletion, search, and traversals.

19. **18-Heaps**  
   Heaps are used for priority queues and sorting algorithms. In this folder, you'll find programs implementing heaps and heap-related algorithms like heap sort and priority queue operations.

20. **19-Hashing**  
   This directory explores the concept of hashing, which is used for efficient data retrieval. Programs include the implementation of hash maps and sets, collision handling techniques, and solving problems like counting frequencies of elements in arrays.

21. **20-Tries**  
   Tries are special trees used to store strings efficiently. This folder contains programs that implement tries and use them for tasks like auto-completion, prefix searching, and word searching.

22. **21-Graphs**  
   Graphs are vital for solving complex problems. This directory covers graph traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS, as well as shortest path algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and Bellman-Ford.

23. **22-Dynamic Programming**  
   Dynamic Programming (DP) is used for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems. In this section, you'll find classic DP problems like the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, and matrix chain multiplication.

24. **23-Segment Tree**  
   Segment trees are used for efficiently solving range query problems. This folder contains programs that implement segment trees for tasks like range sum queries and range minimum queries.
